Nommer
======

From french verb it means *to give a name*, pronounce `\n…î.me\ <https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/nommer>`_

To give a company name, I used to take it's activities words, mix them together and get first letter of the first word, second letter of the second word and so on.
At the end I got a list of "words" and I pick one I like.
